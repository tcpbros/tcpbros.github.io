Para lograr esto git usa un concepto basado en\\nrepositorios remotos, es decir las carpetas que tenemos con nuestros proyectos\\ne historia de los mismos pueden ser almacenados en equipos remotos.</p>\\n<p>Originalmente en git estos estos remotos pueden relacionarse en un grafo\\narbitrario sin embargo, vamos a cubrir en este post un servicio de repositorios\\nremotos centralizado muy popular llamado <a href=\\\"https://github.com\\\">github</a>. Este\\nservicio almacena repositorios y ofrece herramientas que facilitan realizar\\nproyectos de manera colaborativa.</p>\\n<h2>Para empezar</h2>\\n<p>Lo primero que debemos hacer es visitar <a href=\\\"https://github.com\\\">https://github.com</a>\\ncrear una cuenta y crear un repositorio, el sitio web ofrece dos opciones,</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Crear un repositorio vació.</li>\\n<li>Crear un repositorio e inicializarlo con un archivo <code>README</code> o una licencia.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>La primera opción es útil para cuando ya tenemos un repositorio preparado y\\nsolo queremos almacenarlo remotamente. Cuando tomamos esta opcion vamos a\\nnuestra máquina y ejecutamos los siguientes comandos para inicializar el\\nrepositorio remoto:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-bash\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\"># Desde nuestro repositorio</span>\\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;reponame&gt;.git\\ngit push -u origin master\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>La segunda opcion es muy útil cuando aun no tenemos un repositorio\\ninicializado, si usamos esta opción es bueno tomar ventaja de las opciones para\\nagregar un archivo <code>.gitignore</code> y un archivo <code>LICENCE</code>. Si tomamos esta\\nopción vamos a nuestra máquina y ejecutamos los siguientes comandos para\\ninicializar,</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-bash\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\"># Desde nuestra carpeta para código</span>\\ngit <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">clone</span> https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;reponame&gt;.git\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">cd</span> &lt;reponame&gt;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>En ambos casos un remoto llamado <em>origin</em> es agregado a nuestra lista de\\nremotos que podemos ver usando el comando <code>git remote -v</code>.</p>\\n<h2>Mantener el repositorio sincronizado</h2>\\n<p>Bien, ahora que tenemos nuestro repositorio remoto, necesitamos mantener los\\ncambios sincronizados entre los distintos repositorios, local y remoto.</p>\\n<p>Para lograr esto, primero, hagamos un ejemplo,</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-bash\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\"># Desde nuestro repositorio</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\"># Hacemos algunos cambios</span>\\ngit add &lt;archivos cambiados&gt;\\ngit commit -m <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Describo los cambios\\\"</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Luego vamos directamente al repositorio en <a href=\\\"https://github.com\\\">github</a> la url\\ndebe ser algo como <code>https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;reponame&gt;</code> si inspeccionamos\\nlos cambios recientes nos daremos cuenta de que los cambios recientemente\\nrealizados no se encuentran… que contrariedad.</p>\\n<p>Este ni ningún otro servicio de repositorios remotos va a mantener\\nsincronizados los repositorios automáticamente, git predata y además tiene una\\nfilosofía diferente a algo como <a href=\\\"https://dropbox.com\\\">dropbox</a> o <a href=\\\"https://drive.google.com\\\">google\\ndrive</a>. Los repositorios tienen que ser sincronizados\\nmanualmente, para publicar los cambios recientemente realizados, debemos usar\\nel comando:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-bash\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\"># Desde nuestro repositorio</span>\\ngit push origin master\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Donde <code>origin</code> es el nombre del remoto y <code>master</code> es el nombre de la rama\\nremota.

Para lograr esto git usa un concepto basado en\\nrepositorios remotos, es decir las carpetas que tenemos con nuestros proyectos\\ne historia de los mismos pueden ser almacenados en equipos remotos.</p>\\n<p>Originalmente en git estos estos remotos pueden relacionarse en un grafo\\narbitrario sin embargo, vamos a cubrir en este post un servicio de repositorios\\nremotos centralizado muy popular llamado <a href=\\\"https://github.com\\\">github</a>. Este\\nservicio almacena repositorios y ofrece herramientas que facilitan realizar\\nproyectos de manera colaborativa.</p>\\n<h2>Para empezar</h2>\\n<p>Lo primero que debemos hacer es visitar <a href=\\\"https://github.com\\\">https://github.com</a>\\ncrear una cuenta y crear un repositorio, el sitio web ofrece dos opciones,</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Crear un repositorio vació.</li>\\n<li>Crear un repositorio e inicializarlo con un archivo <code>README</code> o una licencia.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>La primera opción es útil para cuando ya tenemos un repositorio preparado y\\nsolo queremos almacenarlo remotamente. Cuando tomamos esta opcion vamos a\\nnuestra máquina y ejecutamos los siguientes comandos para inicializar el\\nrepositorio remoto:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-bash\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\"># Desde nuestro repositorio</span>\\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;reponame&gt;.git\\ngit push -u origin master\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>La segunda opcion es muy útil cuando aun no tenemos un repositorio\\ninicializado, si usamos esta opción es bueno tomar ventaja de las opciones para\\nagregar un archivo <code>.gitignore</code> y un archivo <code>LICENCE</code>. Si tomamos esta\\nopción vamos a nuestra máquina y ejecutamos los siguientes comandos para\\ninicializar,</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-bash\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\"># Desde nuestra carpeta para código</span>\\ngit <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">clone</span> https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;reponame&gt;.git\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">cd</span> &lt;reponame&gt;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>En ambos casos un remoto llamado <em>origin</em> es agregado a nuestra lista de\\nremotos que podemos ver usando el comando <code>git remote -v</code>.</p>\\n<h2>Mantener el repositorio sincronizado</h2>\\n<p>Bien, ahora que tenemos nuestro repositorio remoto, necesitamos mantener los\\ncambios sincronizados entre los distintos repositorios, local y remoto.</p>\\n<p>Para lograr esto, primero, hagamos un ejemplo,</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-bash\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\"># Desde nuestro repositorio</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\"># Hacemos algunos cambios</span>\\ngit add &lt;archivos cambiados&gt;\\ngit commit -m <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Describo los cambios\\\"</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Luego vamos directamente al repositorio en <a href=\\\"https://github.com\\\">github</a> la url\\ndebe ser algo como <code>https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;reponame&gt;</code> si inspeccionamos\\nlos cambios recientes nos daremos cuenta de que los cambios recientemente\\nrealizados no se encuentran… que contrariedad.</p>\\n<p>Este ni ningún otro servicio de repositorios remotos va a mantener\\nsincronizados los repositorios automáticamente, git predata y además tiene una\\nfilosofía diferente a algo como <a href=\\\"https://dropbox.com\\\">dropbox</a> o <a href=\\\"https://drive.google.com\\\">google\\ndrive</a>.
